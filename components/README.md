# components

## 結構說明

- Under `components/ui/`, place the basic components generated by shadcn-cli (e.g., npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert).

- Under `components/`, place the reusable components that can be used by at least two pages or components.

- Components generated by `shadcn-cli` use `kebab-case.tsx`, while all others use `PascalCase.tsx` naming.
