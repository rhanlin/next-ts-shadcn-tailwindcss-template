# Components

## Structure Explanation

- Components under `components/ui/` are basic elements generated by `shadcn-cli` (ex. `npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert`).

- Components in `components/` are reusable and can be used by at least two pages or components.

- Components produced by `shadcn-cli` are named in `kebab-case.tsx`, while others use `PascalCase.tsx` naming.
