# app

## Structure Explanation

- Besides [Next.js file conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions) files (e.g., `page.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `layout.tsx`), all other components use `PascalCase` naming.

- Related components are initially placed under the respective page folder. If they are reused, they are moved to the `components/` folder.
